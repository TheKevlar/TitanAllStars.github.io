## Welcome

Welcome to **Titan All Stars** guild playing **Hero Wars** on server 20 **Tempered Steel**.  

Swing by our  **[Discord Chat Server](https://discord.gg/KPpxgdD)** and introduce yourself...
* How long your been playing?  
* What you want out of a guild? 

Newbies and experienced players looknig for a fresh start are all welcome. <br>
Enthusism and consistency is as important as experience. With those, we can build you into a strong player valuable to the team.

Of course, you should know [why a guild is useful to you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_-sNpLHeOw)

## Get your titan name 
If you're ammenable, get with the theme and **[choose a Titan name from this list](https://www.theoi.com/greek-mythology/titans.html)** (or elsewhere) <br>
Change your in-game name by clicking your profile icon in top left of screen. <br>

## Real world money
The elephant in the room is whether games like Hero Wars force you to **Pay To Win**. So far (level 50) it doesn't. 
The general philosophy of the guild is **Free To Play**.  Where is the fun and challenge in just forking over cash. 
Howver if you're going to be spending weeks on the game, a couple of small purchases are suggested, but purely optional...

### VIP Level 1
Benefit: **INSTANT RAID** saves your real-world time when mining for equipment to promote your heros. <br>
Cost: One-time $1.99 AUD; <br>
Period: Permanent <br>

### Valkyrie's Favor
Benefit: Combat 5x speed-up saves your real-world time.  Also Arifact Coins and Cores help earlt levelelling of artifacts.  <br>
Cost: Weekly $3.29 AUD; <br>
Period: Two weeks <br>

## Titanite
* The optimal amount of titanite to aim for each day is 150. You have two daily quests with targets of 75 and 150, which EACH return you ONE Titan Summoning Sphere. Doing beyond 150 a day moves you into harder territory with less sphere power-ups.
* The guild target is 3000 per day, which returns each member THREE Titan Summoning Spheres.  This is easy to achieve if everyone chips in - even if only 20 of the 30 guild members make the quota. Lets help each other get those bonus spheres.
* This is a vituous cycle. The additional titan levelling from the extra Summoning Spheres allows you to more easily mine titanite.
* Levelling up your titans provides "Sparks" to power-up your heros' Gift Of The Elements. 

## Emeralds
* Generally, here is [where to spend your emeralds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYDR0TkNnDU&feature=emb_rel_pause)
* Its beneficial to spending your first emeralds powering-up your Titans up to between levels 10 to 15, to kick off a virtuous-cycle of titanite gathering.  Strong titans also greatly assist the Guild Wars.      
* Do also open three chests up per Outland Boss win, to get additional Artifact Coins.  Use those Artifact Coins to power-up your A-Team's first artifacts to 100%-Activation. 
* Minimise emerald to coin conversions - unless some special event gives extreme bonuses.
* Avoid opening extra chests in Tower.  As a general rule only open ONE-OF-THREE Tower Chests, unless you see something particularly needful.  
* Do look for the red-dot on emerald buttons as shown below...

which returns more emeralds than you spend through the attached Quest (in this case an extra 500)...

##  Member performance

The point of a guild is to assist each other to progress through the game.  
Hero Wars is easy to free-to-play - so there are a lot of transient sightseers, or players that make a start then lose interest.
We would like to leave slots free for new blood (beginner or experienced) who are ethusiastic about progressing in the game.
To this end, there need to be some criteria with which to leave those slots open.
The in-game progress tables located under **Gifts > View** provide the best measure of performance.

Unless otherwise arranged with elder members, candidates-to-be-dropped will be prioritised as follows...
1. Low Titanite total - lack of interest in helping your fellow members (75 or 150 a day helps keep the doctor away)
1. Early Activity followed by no activity - not playing the game
1. Low overall Activity per rolling weekly Total - not playing the game
1. Player name not changed from default - not engaged in the game

Membership management will be frequent, but particularly on Tuesday when it becomes apparent that weekend-only players are not contributing during the week.
If you are dropped for lack of activity, do feel free to rejoin for the periods when you have more time to commit.  Just don't leave us hanging.  Communication is the key.

## War
* The War Party consists of FIFTEEN "guild champion" battle teams seleected daily.
* Winning a battle rewards the guild champions with trophies that can buy power-up Hero Skins.
* Obviously, to win, the most powerful of the teams are prioritised, but there is also always lower level mop up that gives less powerful players a chance to participate and gain experience.  
* In the past, things have broken down when less committed players simply don't turn up for the battle.  Points are lost, league standing lowered and rewards reduced.  This usually occurs with newer players at the lower power levels.  Also we should rotate the bottom positions to give new blood a try. So lower level positions potentially open each day. If you want a run in the War Party, just ask.   
* The most important thing about joining the War Party is reliability.  Its REALLY bad for us if you don't turn up.
* Teams are locked in a day in advance.  If you are not going to be able to attend, **PLEASE COMMUNICATE** and opt-out.  Good communication will be viewed very favourably in considering more permanent placement in the War Party.  
* Show your commitment and reliability to your guild mates by regularly completing you quota of 150 titanite.

## Titans
* Levelling up from 1 to 51 you can choose to spend either 5,130 emeralds or 25,650 potions. The former is easier, so **hoard your emeralds for levelling titans**.
