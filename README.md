## Real money spending strategy
Hero Wars is reasonably practical to **Play For Free** (at least up to level 40 so far).
But some consider spending a **minimal amount real money** to be worthwhile, as discussed below.

### VIP Level 1
Cost: One-time $1.99 AUD; <br>
Benefit: Enables **Instant Raid** - this can save hours when farming for equipment to **promote** your heros.  <br>
Period: Permanent <br>

### Valkyrie's Favor
Cost: Weekly $3.29 AUD; <br>
Benefit: Useful in the early stages (mainly for 5x combat speed???) <br>
Period: Some suggest its useful for two weeks (currently not clear on the exit condition??) <br>

## Emeralds strategy
The priority for your emeralds is to spend them on powering up your Titans after you've joined a guild.

**Don't...**
* Opening extra chests in Tower.  As a general rule, only open one-of-three Tower Chests, unless you see something particularly needful.  

**Do...**
* Look for the red-dot on green button shown below...

The attached Quest actually makes you extra emeralds (in this case an extra 500)...
