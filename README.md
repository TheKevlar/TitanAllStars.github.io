## Real money spending strategy
With Hero Wars its reasonably practical to Play For Free without any hidden traps (at least up to level 40 so far).
But some consider a few minimal-spend of real money to be worthwhile.

### VIP Level 1
Cost: One time $1.99 AUD.  
Benefit: Permanently enables **Instant Raid** - this can save hours when farming for equipment to **promote** your heros.  

### Valkyrie's Favor
Cost: Weekly $3.29 AUD.  
Benefit: .... useful in the early stages (??may only need one week??)

## Emeralds strategy
The priority for your emeralds is to spend them on powering up your Titans after you've joined a guild.

Don't spend emeralds on...
* Opening extra chests in Tower.  As a general rule, only open one of the three Tower Chests, unless you see something particularly needful.  

Do look for the red-dot on green button shown below.  The attached Quest actually makes you 500 emeralds - easy money.
