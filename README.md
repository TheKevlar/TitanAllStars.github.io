## Welcome

**Welcome to Titan All Stars!!!!** playing **Hero Wars** on **"Tempered Steel"** (server 20).  

Newbies welcome. We're happy the help you get the most out of the game.  <br>
Swing by our **[Discord Chat Server](https://discord.gg/KPpxgdD)** and introduce yourself...
* How long your been playing?  
* What you want out of your guild? 

If accepted to join, in keeping with the theme, it would be nice if you **[choose a Titan name](https://www.theoi.com/greek-mythology/titans.html)** (set in-game by clicking your profile icon in top left) <br>

Enthusism is as important as experience. We'll help build you into a player valuable to the team, and kick that off with these tips...

## Real world money
The general philosophy of the guild is **Free To Play**, but suggest a couple of small purchases that may be worthwhile to optimise your real-world-time and enjoyment...

### VIP Level 1
Cost: One-time $1.99 AUD; <br>
Period: Permanent <br>
Benefit: Enables **Instant Raid** - this can save hours when farming for equipment to **promote** your heros.  <br>

### Valkyrie's Favor
Cost: Weekly $3.29 AUD; <br>
Period: Some suggest its useful for two weeks (currently not clear on the exit condition??) <br>
Benefit: Helps get early Arifact Coins and Cores for upgrading heros.  Also 5x combat speed benefits practical use of your time.  <br>

## Titanite
* The optimal amount of titanite to aim for is 150. You have two daily quests with targets of 75 and 150, which EACH return you ONE Titan Summoning Sphere. Doing beyond 150 a day moves you into harder territory with less sphere power-ups.
* The guild has a cummulative target of 3000 which returns you THREE Titan Summoning Spheres - easy to achieve if 20 of the 30 guild members do their part. Lets help each other get there.
* This is a vituous cycle. The additional titan levelling from the extra Summoning Spheres allows you to more easily mine titanite.
* Levelling up your titans provides "Sparks" to power-up your heros' Gift Of The Elements. 

## Emeralds
* Generally, here is [where to spend your emeralds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYDR0TkNnDU&feature=emb_rel_pause)
* Specifically, our guild requests you prioritize spending emeralds on powering-up your Titans. Bump'em up before hitting the Dungeon.  This helps a virtuous cycle of farming titanite to hit your 150 titanate quota.  Strong titans also greatly assist the Guild Wars, where the higher we place the quicker you receive your Hero Skin power-up from the Guild War Shop.     
* Do also open three chests up per Outland Boss win, to get additional Artifact Coins.  Use those Artifact Coins to power-up your A-Team's first artifacts to 100%-Activation. 
* Minimise emerald to coin conversions - unless some special event gives extreme bonuses.
* Avoid opening extra chests in Tower.  As a general rule only open ONE-OF-THREE Tower Chests, unless you see something particularly needful.  
* Do look for the red-dot on emerald buttons as shown below...  
![Chest Buttons](https://herowars.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/360039180114/mceclip0.png)      
which returns more emeralds than you spend through the attached Quest (in this case an extra 500)...

##  Member performance

The point of a guild is to assist each other to progress through the game.  
Hero Wars is easy to free-to-play - so there are a lot of transient sightseers, or players that make a start then lose interest.
We would like to leave slots free for new blood (beginner or experienced) who are ethusiastic about progressing in the game.
To this end, there need to be some criteria with which to leave those slots open.
The tables located under **Gifts > View** provide the best measure of performance.

Unless otherwise arranged with elder members, candidates-to-be-dropped will be prioritised as follows...
1. Low Titanite total - lack of interest in helping your fellow members (75 or 150 a day helps keep the doctor away)
1. Early Activity followed by no activity - not playing the game
1. Low overall Activity per rolling weekly Total - not playing the game
1. Player name not changed from default - not engaged in the game

A leave-of-absense can be requested (i.e. voluntarily/temporarily give up your slot). A policy of maintaining open slots will assist your return.

Membership management will be frequent, but particularly on Tuesday to clear out what seem weekend-only players.
If you are dropped for lack of activity, feel free to rejoin for the periods when you have more time to commit.
